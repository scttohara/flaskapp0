# intro_to_flask
repo for an intro. to flask project

Followed the YouTube video from freeCodeCamp.org linked **>** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA&t=1166s

*There were some issues in the above video where the code UI result was ahead of what had been typed on video. So my UI didn't match the video. I thought it was me, but the comments on YT clarified that a lot of people had issues. So I referenced the github code related to the video to figure out issues with UI results.*  
**The github is here > https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction**
